### An iOS application for learning Vedas

This is a rewrite of an applicationt that I currently have in the app store, which has been there since iOS 3. I've now decided it is time to take a look at Swift 3 and this app is a good opportunity for me to take what I've done in Objective-C and port over to Swift.

## Things that I learnt so far

   - Dealing with plist files in swift is much nicer
   - Tests are easier to implement with swift
   - Swift is slowly but surely replacing some of the Objective-C naming convertions e.g. `UIBundle` is now called `Bundle`
